        <dt>Barcode Terminal is application for import and usage of data
          obtained from mobile barcode scanning app "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svitlytskyi.barcodecollector.pro.release&amp;pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">SVP
            Barcode Collector</a>". While it initially designed to&nbsp; use
          data of just mentioned "<em>Barcode Collector</em>" (further - <em>BCC</em>)&nbsp;
          - nevertheless, technically - it can be used for import of barcode
          collection data from any source, provided that it obey required
          format.&nbsp; Format is pretty simple - old plain CSV or XLS files,
          containing mandatory 'barcode' column and several supplementary
          columns, part of which is optional.</dt>

        <dd><em style="color: #336666;">"Barcode Collector" ("BCC") is <strong>free</strong>
            Android barcode scanner designed to serve as Data Terminal in wide
            range of works where hardware laser scanner facilities usually
            engaged. It maintains it's own mobile database to store collections
            of scanned data: barcode, quantity and optional name and images
            attached. Collections ('tasks') may subsequently&nbsp; be shared to
            arbitrary destination in the form of XLS,CSV,JSON or XML files.</em></dd>

      <p>&nbsp;With Barcode Terminal in a couple of minutes we can prepare
        voluminous purchase order, or sale order - about hundred items in size,
        or just update images of products using mobile camera</p>

          Odoo workstation. The most convenient options is e-mail or
          cloud data storage</li>
        <li> BCC is supplied with it's own comprehensive description - so lets
          won't stuck much on this subject</li>
        <li>3) In Odoo open this application "<em>Barcode terminal</em>" and
          press "<em>Upload</em>" button to open wizard for data import.</li>

          is a convenient intermediate data structure for automated creation of
          various primary business document, by filling multiple product lines
          based on obtained barcode data. Here we can see collection attributes:
          <em>Name</em> and unique <em>Version ID</em>. This attributes are
          mandatory,&nbsp; but serves purely for identification. <em>Name</em>
          could be edited arbitrary. <em>Comment</em> is optional.Further there

    <section class="oe_container">
      <h2 style=" text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993399;">Mail
          aliases</span></h2>
      <p>Mail aliases&nbsp; is standard Odoo&nbsp; automation feature that&nbsp;
        allows&nbsp; to create document from incoming e-mail. So each alias
        record&nbsp; sets up connection between message attributes&nbsp; and
        generation of certain document types. Barcode Terminal as well can
        leverage this facility to make work more convenient. As a result this
        will allow you to bypass the stage of manual file downloading (step - 3
        from start guide ). On Android device you or your business client just
        export the job to email and after some time in Odoo side (new email is
        usually checked every 5 min.) you have new "<em>Barcode Collection</em>"
        documents.</p>
      <p>Odoo messaging system is pretty flexible and has many variants of
        tuning. If you never use this aliases before - please refer to Odoo
        official documents for help to better understanding. Here I'd like just
        highlight the main key points from the users point of view - what is
        needed to make mail alias working.</p>
      <table style="width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="20">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: right;">Fig. 7</td>
            <td><img src="Fig7.png" title="Alias domain"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li> 1) First of all there must be "<em>Alias Domain</em>" set in Odoo
          settings for yous company (let's say it will be:
          @your_company_aliases.com).</li>
        <li>2) Then you have to agree with sysadmin for you to use one of
          address of this domain as alias for "Barcode Collection" documents.
          Let it be for example: "<em>barcode_terminal@your_company_aliases.com</em>".
          You can choose arbitrary local part instead of "<em>barcode_terminal</em>".
          From admin you need only this mailbox to be working and able to
          receive incoming mail. </li>
        <li>3) Then you set this local part of address in configuration record
          form (<em>Barcode Terminal -&gt; menu "Configuration" -&gt; "Barcode
            collection E-Mail alias"</em>.) to obtain actual alias address.</li>
      </ul>
      <table style="width: 100%;" border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;"><img src="Fig8.png" title="Barcode termilal alias"></td>
            <td style="text-align: center;"><img src="Fig9.png" title="Edit alias record"><br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Fig. 8</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Fig. 9</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p> Once it set - it is ready to work. Technically we can configure
        several alias , but in fact you need just one.&nbsp; </p>
      We could as well consider another possible scenario. Supposing - you run a
      small company, you are on your own with Odoo base - director and sysadmin
      in one person. In this case probably the simplest way to make aliases
      working - to use one of free email services like <em>gmail</em> or <em>outlook</em>.
      So you
      <ul>
        <li>1) get new gmail mailbox (e.g. bct_alias@gmail.com). </li>
        <li>2) Then you have to setup this mailbox as new incoming mail server
          in Odoo settings and make sure that it is working and has status&nbsp;
          <strong>confirmed</strong>. (Fig 7 point 1)</li>
        <li>3) Then set "@gmail.com" as "<em>Alias Domain</em>" (Fig 7 point 2)</li>
        <li>4) Finally edit Barcode Terminal alias record as in previous case
          (Fig. 8, 9)&nbsp; to obtain alias with "<em>bct_alias@gmail.com</em>"
          address.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The only tricky part in this is may be - step #2. This famous global
        services are very easy to use with web UI or dedicated desktop clients,
        but when it comes about using with third-party applications - the task
        became more complicated via the need of setting up OAuth protocol.
        Luckily, Odoo documentation has comprehensive guides for this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/applications/general/email_communication/google_oauth.html#"
            title="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/applications/general/email_communication/google_oauth.html#"
            target="_blank">https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/applications/general/email_communication/google_oauth.html#</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          and</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/applications/general/email_communication/azure_oauth.html"
            target="_blank">https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/applications/general/email_communication/azure_oauth.html</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>It may seems confusing at first but if you fulfill all carefully, you
        should succeed. You may also choose to try other way: all around the
        world there are usually a lot of not so well&nbsp; known services not
        willing to maintain security in so high level. They often do things
        simpler - without OAuth - especially for free plans. With this all the
        setup process is to input username and password. One more detail worth
        mentioning , when testing aliases - is how they tell already processed
        messages. For "<strong>imap</strong>" protocol it being marked as read
        and next time ignored when checked. So if you are waiting for new
        document appear in Odoo and decide to see if the source message is in
        right place using client UI - it will be marked as read - and you
        should&nbsp; mark it unread for all this worked out properly.</p>
      <p>There is preset default alias record - feel free to edit it according
        to just described logic, or create new one, experimenting and choose
        what is better for you. We just don't recommend to use for this your
        private general-purpose mailbox, especially with <em>POP</em> access.
        While it should work for test due to filtering, if you proceed using it
        in production stage, it may turn out that Odoo will every 5 minutes
        doing stupid work on filtering all the same tonnes of irrelevant
        messages trying to find alias data. It is of course huge wasting of
        resources and could impact overall performance. So it should be special
        dedicated mailbox: new one or that purged before.&nbsp; <br>

      <h1 style=" text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993399;">Extencibility
          and limitations</span></h1>
      <p>This last section has more technical character and is addressed rather
        to developers that would have an interest to customize program closer to
        end user real situation.</p>
      <p>To provide "implementation" function&nbsp; - this program uses so
        called "implementation templates". It is auxiliary records , that set
        mapping correspondence between fields&nbsp; of "<em>Barcode Collection</em>"
        record fields and resulting fields of target primary documents. One can
        study it using configuration menu. There are several preset templates
        but new can be created as well. Business documents often the combination
        of two or more data models connected with some kind of relations, so -
        there provided wizard for selection of possible combinations of parent
        document headers and multiline part records, containing products. Result
        of such wizard is just a billet - you can add or remove field
        correspondences according to common sense. Further we utilize standard
        Odoo ability to open prefilled forms for new records using context. So
        far it sounds like pretty simple technics.&nbsp; And it works, but not
        always. Many of Odoo documents have it's own builtin automation
        calculations that may interfere or simply obliterate the results of
        context prefilling. In such cases we agree this app is not applicable.
        It is because this application&nbsp; is common purpose or "universal" by
        design. One other possible way to overcome described problems - would be
        - to try to extend or change existing documents. Here this approach is
        definitely <strong>NOT ACCEPTED .</strong> Main rule was - never change
        existing mechanisms - just add new possibilities. It means that there
        are no possible side effects of installing application as is.&nbsp; But
        this is of course should not necessary be so strict taboo for local
        customisers, working closer to users, observing local business logic. As
        an example of&nbsp; <span searchabletext="
                                    Check to allow using templates with mute mode, skipping WYSIWYG-type document forms                                ">
          <span searchabletext="
                                    Check to allow using templates with mute mode, skipping WYSIWYG-type document forms                                ">WYSIWYG</span></span>
        technics failure is generation of Pricelist documents from Barcode
        Collections: In Odoo 16 and 18 it is not working. But there still one
        workaround exists. We call it "Forced generation". That is when new
        documents creation committed in database right away rather than present
        new form that you can save or cancel.&nbsp; May be this is not a kind of
        design someone could call elegant. But we preserve it as an option. It
        is disabled by default but can be enabled for some templates in
        configuration. </p>

      <p>Who knows , may be this is the kind of automation someone needs most of
        all. Ability to create pricelists from barcodes may appear useful in
        situations when manager have to set prices of products outdoor based on
        real-time product condition (e.g. vegetables or fruits)&nbsp; </p>
